  <p>For 2024 I will be learning Go. Well, relearning some of it as I have coded small systems applications in Go before.
I will be posting any links and tools I discover here on this blog with the tag of golang.
The book I will be using is not that new but, it not costly. I it is <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440">The Go Programming Language, by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan</a> It is from 2016 so will be missing some of the newer features of Go such as Genetics and Modules. But as my main aim is simply to get going with coding small applications and web services then I can look to learn about those later.
